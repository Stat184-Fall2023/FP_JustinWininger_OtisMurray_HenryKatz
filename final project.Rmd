collegeOffense$YPG <- as.numeric(collegeOffense$YPG)

#get total stats by multiplying per game stats by games played

#round all values to nearest whole number

## College Data

```{r college visualization}
gf_point(Points~Yards, data=collegeOffense, linewidth=1)%>%gf_lm()
```

```{r regression analysis}
collegeModel <- lm(Points~Yards, data=collegeOffense)
mplot(collegeModel, which=1)
mplot(collegeModel, which=2)
cooksplot(collegeModel)
summary(collegeModel)
```



two data sets, one nfl teams, one college teams, does total yards affect total points scored? Is there a relationship
